WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THIS PACKAGE
---------------------------------

This package contains an Urbi-sdk allowing you to create remote UObjects for any robot.

URBI is an object oriented language, based on a prototype approach. You can define objects in pure URBI, or plug C++ classes called "UObjects" directly in the kernel to add these classes to the language, like a native URBI class. You can even unplug the UObject from the kernel and run it as a remote autonomous application, taking the IP address of the URBI Engine as a parameter. You get a remote object, and it's completely transparent.

If you want to plug UObjects directly in the kernel you have to get an Urbi-engine sdk for your specific robot.

This package countains also the liburbi c++ version.

Liburbi-c++ is a library designed to encapsulate an URBI connection. It handles the TCP connection with the URBI server, and the dispatching of messages it sends. The library is thread-safe and reentrant.
